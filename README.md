# Bookstore-Database-Management
- As the name suggests, the Online Bookstore Project is the project through which one will be able to purchase books online.
- This simple online web book store was made by using PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap. One of my initial projects while learning the PHP programming language. <br />
- It has a form for user to input query information to search the books from database. <br />
- The control function is designed to process the input from the user's interface, generate the searching query and then gets data from the database and returns to the user's interface. <br />

## The CRUD Operations
CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. CRUD operations are basic data manipulation for database. <br />
It can also describe user-interface conventions that allow viewing, searching and modifying information through computer-based forms and reports. In essence, entities are read, created, updated and deleted. Those same entities can be modified by taking the data from a service and changing the setting properties before sending the data back to the service for an update. Plus, CRUD is data-oriented and the standardized use of HTTP action verbs. <br />
